# ai-nanodegree

This is repository of projects and work performed while going through the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree. Below are lists of the following projects to be built and completed during the course:

<ul>
<li>Build a Sudoku Solver
<li>Build a Forward Planning Agent
<li>Build an Adversarial Game Playing Agent
<li>Part of Speech Tagging
</ul>

The following descriptions for each project are pulled from the AI Nanodegree syllabus:

<h3>Sudoku Solver</h3>
Humans use reason to solve problems by decomposing the problem statement and incorporating domain
knowledge to limit the possible solution space. In this project youâ€™ll use a technique called constraint
propagation together with backtracking search to make an agent that only considers reasonable solution
candidates and efficiently solves any Sudoku puzzle. This approach appears in many classical AI problems,
and the solution techniques have been extended and applied to diverse problems in bioinformatics,
logistics, and operations research. In this project you will demonstrate some basic algorithms knowledge, and learn to use constraint
satisfaction to solve general problems
