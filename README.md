<a href="https://github.com/alekzandr/ai-nanodegree/tree/master/Sudoku"><h3>Sudoku Solver</h3></a>
Humans use reason to solve problems by decomposing the problem statement and incorporating domain
knowledge to limit the possible solution space. In this project, I use a technique called constraint
propagation together with backtracking search to make an agent that only considers reasonable solution
candidates and efficiently solves any Sudoku puzzle. This approach appears in many classical AI problems,
and the solution techniques have been extended and applied to diverse problems in bioinformatics,
logistics, and operations research. In this project I demonstrate some basic algorithms knowledge, and use of constraint
satisfaction to solve general problems


<h3>Forward Planning Agent</h3>
Intelligent agents are expected to act in complex domains where their goals and objectives may not be
immediately achievable. They must reason about their goals and make rational choices of actions to achieve
them. In this project I build a system using symbolic logic to represent general problem domains and
use classical search to find optimal plans for achieving my agent’s goals. Planning & scheduling systems
power modern automation & logistics operations, and aerospace applications like the Hubble telescope &
NASA Mars rovers. In this project I demonstrate an understanding of classical optimization & search algorithms,
symbolic logic, and domain-independent planning.


<h3>Adversarial Game Playing Agent</h3>
AI agents acting in the real world have to “hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.” In this project, I 
write an agent that uses that idea to make rational choices to achieve super-human performance in
games competing against adversarial agents. The principles of adversarial search provide a foundation for
autonomous agents acting in the real world, and for understanding modern advances in AI like DeepMind’s
AlphaGo Zero. In this project I demonstrate advanced algorithms knowledge, including minimax with alpha-beta
pruning for adversarial search.


<h3>Part of Speech Tagging</h3>
Probabilistic models allow my agents to better handle the uncertainty of the real world by explicitly
modeling their belief state as a distribution over all possible states. In this project I use a Hidden
Markov Model (HMM) to perform part of speech tagging, a common pre-processing step in Natural
Language Processing. HMMs have been used extensively in NLP, speech recognition, bioinformatics, and
computer vision tasks.
